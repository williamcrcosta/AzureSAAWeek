# Local .terraform directories
#
# These directories are created by `terraform init` and contain the
# terraform state, modules, and plugins used by your configuration.
#
# They are usually not checked in to version control, but you may want to
# add them to your .gitignore file if you prefer to have a clean working
# directory when you clone your repository.
#
# See https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/files/structure.html for more
# information about the structure of a terraform configuration.

# .tfstate files
#
# These files contain the state of your infrastructure, and are usually
# not checked in to version control. If you prefer to have a clean working
# directory when you clone your repository, you may want to add these
# files to your .gitignore file.
#
# See https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/state/index.html for more
# information about the tfstate file.

# Crash log files
#
# These files are created by terraform if it crashes during execution
# and contain information about the failure.
#
# They are usually not checked in to version control.
crash.log
crash.*.log

# Exclude all .tfvars files, which are likely to contain sensitive data,
# such as password, private keys, and other secrets.
#
# These should not be part of version control as they are data points
# which are potentially sensitive and subject to change depending on
# the environment.

# Ignore override files as they are usually used to override resources
# locally and so are not checked in

# See https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/modules/override.html
